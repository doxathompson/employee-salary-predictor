# Employee Salary Prediction

## 📄 Description

This project uses a **Linear Regression** model to predict the **salary of employees** based on various features, such as **age**, **gender**, **education level**, **job title**, and **years of experience**. The model is trained on a dataset containing simulated employee data.

The project features a **Streamlit frontend** that allows users to input the required features and get a salary prediction. The model and frontend are deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for easy access.
